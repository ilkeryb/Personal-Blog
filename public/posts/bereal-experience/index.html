For those who are unfamiliar, BeReal is a Social Media platform. The concept is simple: “Every day at a different time, everyone is notified simultaneously to capture and share a Photo in 2 Minutes”. There are no ads on the platform yet. And though there is an option to share photos publicly, almost everyone shares BeReals only with their Friends. It is, in theory, an efficient way to keep in touch with people.\nIt is a Social Media App Nonetheless. I acknowledge that in this day and age, social interactions mostly happen on the Net. This is not my preferred method of socializing. Also, BeReal is neither free nor open source.\nMy BeReal Experience   My First BeReal Post. As you can I was little confused.  I consider myself an outgoing person. I generally would like to increase my connectivity if I have the chance. By not participating in social media I become practically more and more out of touch. Which is not the biggest deal in the world.\nWith the encouragement of my friends, I was ready to give BeReal a shot . From what they’ve told me it seemed like a nice way to nourish real-life friendships digitally. Since everyone is “Real”, It wouldn’t suffer from the algorithmic toxicity that other platforms suffer.\nDemographics of the BeReal As far as I understand BeReal lets you send friendship request to people on your contact list (If they also have saved your phone number), I have about 650 people on my contact list and about 25 of them was available for me to send requests to. Keeping in mind that almost nobody saves phone numbers as rigorously as I do, they’ve managed to congregate a respectable amount of people. But I wouldn’t consider BeReal mainstream (yet). I also have to add that, though I like my friends on BeReal, not many people I consider within my inner circle was using BeReal. I was effectively opening myself to people I know but don’t have many memories with.\nI ain’t available! BeReal only has three time zones. Since Turkey’s timezone is ahead of Continental Europe’s, most BeReal times happen in the evenings and sometimes even late at night. Hence for some people BeReal time is irrelevant and they post late BeReals. I tried to be loyal to the call of duty as possible throughout my experience.\nHow Real Be Thy BeReal? As far as I remember I’ve never tried to look handsom-er, I tried to look funny a few times. Assuming all my friends are being real all my lady friends seem to be super-models! Jokes aside people are generally being real most of the time and I was always able to find interesting stuff in my feed. The app helped me to get to know better some of my friends. Also, I better observed the social dynamics surrounding me(like learning who hangs out with who). Still, I don’t know what could I do with that information.\n  A very real BeReal.  Even before starting to use BeReal, I knew that it could affect my decision-making to some extent. BeReal, when compared to other social media platforms, is considerably less addictive. There is no (meaningful) infinite scroll or catchy sound effects. In a day, there are only so many posts, only so many interactions, and only so much time you can spend without getting bored. But for me, it is one of the only engaging apps on my mobile phone. I try to reduce things that could negatively affect my concentration and mindfulness1. BeReal is the only non-utilitarian app that is allowed to have notifications. I find myself checking BeReal about four times a day, which is probably not the intended use. I also happened to realize BeReal provokes action in my life. I caught myself doing stuff just because BeReal time might come thrice. This is not a pronounced effect nor a strictly negative one. But I’m not sure whether I want BeReal to be a deciding factor in my life.\nSuspicious Correlations  Since installing BeReal, my active time shifted towards evenings, which in turn led to later bedtime on average.2 My mobile screen time jumped from two and a half hours to around four hours daily. Though BeReal itself doesn’t take much of my time, it sometimes starts a cycle of procrastination. It seems to happen more often than I’m comfortable with. I also certainly interact with my friends on BeReal more than with most of the people who don’t use BeReal. Which in long run might affect my social circle in a pronounced way.  We don’t have a future together I don’t think BeReal will be part of my life far in the future. It serves a purpose for me right now but it is not a long-term solution for several reasons. I will take steps to mitigate the downsides. I might also delete the app altogether on a whim.\nTLDR By ChatGPT The author reflects on their experience using BeReal, a social media platform where users capture and share photos at a designated time every day. The author initially joins the platform at the encouragement of friends but acknowledges that social media isn’t their preferred method of socializing. They mention that the demographics of BeReal users are still limited and the app’s time zones may not be convenient for everyone. Despite these limitations, the author finds that the app provides real and interesting content, but can also become addictive and negatively impact their daily habits and social circle. Ultimately, the author doesn’t see BeReal as a long-term solution and plans to limit or remove its impact on their life.\n  Mindfulness is a strange concept. I might make a blog post about it. ↩︎\n This might be a spurious correlation. Since it is hard to isolate the effect of BeReal from exam week and holidays. ↩︎\n   ","wordCount":"980","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://blog.ilkeryb.com/%3Cimage%20path/url%3E","datePublished":"2023-01-30T19:15:03+03:00","dateModified":"2023-01-30T19:15:03+03:00","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://blog.ilkeryb.com/posts/bereal-experience/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Ilker's Blog","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://blog.ilkeryb.com/favicon.ico"}}}</script>
